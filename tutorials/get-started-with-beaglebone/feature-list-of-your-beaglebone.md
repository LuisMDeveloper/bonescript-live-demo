*   Built-in networking: Not only does the BeagleBone have an on-board Ethernet connection, but all the basic networking tools that come packaged with Linux are available. You can use services like FTP, Telnet, and SSH, or even host your own web server on the board. 

*   Remote access: Because of its built-in network services, the BeagleBone makes it much easier to access electronics projects remotely over the internet. For example, if you have a data-logging project, you can download the saved data using an FTP client or you can even have your project email you data automatically. Remote access also allows you to log into the device to update the code. 

*   Timekeeping: Without extra hardware, the board can keep track of the date and time of day, and it’s updated by pinging internet time servers, ensuring that it’s always accurate.

*   File system: Just like our computers, embedded Linux platforms have a built-in file system, so storing, organizing, and retrieving data is a fairly trivial matter.

*   Multiple programming languages: You can write your custom code in almost any language you’re most comfortable with: C, C++, Python, Perl, Ruby, Java, or even a shell script.

*   Much of the Linux software that’s already out there can be run on the BeagleBone. 

*   Linux support: There’s no shortage of Linux support information on the web, and community help sites like stackoverflow.com come in handy when a challenge comes along. 

*   Multitasking: Unlike a basic microcontroller, embedded Linux platforms can share the processor between concurrently running programs and tasks. For example, if your project needs to upload a large file to a server, it doesn’t need to stop its other functions to wait for the upload.

*   USB: The BeagleBone can act as both a USB host and a USB device — not only can you control it from your computer, you can also connect USB devices to it. This makes it easy to integrate common USB peripherals like flash drives, wi-fi adapters, and webcams into your projects.

*   Size: The BeagleBone packs all these features into a small form factor. In fact, it fits perfectly into an Altoids tin!
